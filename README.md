# Flow üíß 
Water Flow is controlled by two motors.  
Water from the tank to the grow bed is controlled by an AC motor that is controlled by a relay.  
To drain the grow bed a 12V motor is controlled by a MOSFET, as it drains it gets filtered once more before re-entering the fish tank.

# Lights üí°
Their are three sets of lights in the system. Grow lights, day time tank lights and night time tank lights. All lights are on an adjustable time schedule and can be munally switched on and off.

# Atmosphere ‚òÅÔ∏è
Temperature and humidity are measure at the end of each cycle and reported to the server.

# Communication 
The Arduino and Flask server communicate over HTTP requests using JSON to format responses and requests.
